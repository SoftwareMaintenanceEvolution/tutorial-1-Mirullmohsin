# Introduction
Hi! I'm Amirul Aiman bin Mohsin, a student in the Software Maintenance 
and Evolution course. 
I am excited to improve my skills in software maintenance and evolution.
- **Fun fact**: I love listening to music on Spotify to improve my mood.
- **Course expectations**: I hope to learn best practices for maintaining software, working with real-world legacy systems, and becoming proficient in debugging and refactoring code.
